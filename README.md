# Snakes-and-Ladders
a Java game I made

The game contains no actual visuals of the board, everything is done in console.
The initial board is saved on "jsonlenta.json", a picture of how the initial board looks like is added.
the game lets you modify the board and then play with a selected number of players.
The game "uses" a 6-sided die and when a 6 is rolled, the player adds a mine on the board, which when stepped on, makes the player go 6 tiles back.
